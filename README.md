## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/TtUjDt19eIHxNQ4n5jps) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.

Challenge: Create a job search using an API. Use Front-end libraries like React or Vue. Donâ€™t look at the existing solution. Fulfill user stories below:

- User story: I can see a list of jobs in a city by default
- User story: I can search for jobs with a given keyword
- User story: I can search for jobs with a city name, zip code, or other location
- User story: I can select one option from at least 4 pre-defined options
- User story: I can search for a full-time job only
- User story: I can see a list of jobs with their logo, company name, location, and posted time.
- User story: When I select a job, I can see job descriptions and how to apply like the given design.
- User story: When I am on the job details page, I can go back to the search page
- User story (optional): I can see a list of jobs in the closest city from my location by default
- User story (optional): I can see jobs on different pages, 5 items on each page

INFOS: API - (https://jobs.github.com/api) is not working since 2019.
=> I use a fake data (jobs.json) to demonstrate all functionalities.
